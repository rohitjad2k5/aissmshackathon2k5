# Alternative Paths Agent Documentation

## Overview
The **Alternative Paths Agent** helps users explore different career directions based on their skills. Instead of committing to a single domain, users can see:
- **Alternative domains** they could pursue with minimal retraining
- **Skill transfers** that leverage existing expertise
- **Risk assessment** for each path (easy pivots vs ambitious moves)
- **Lateral moves** within their domain (specializations)
- **Detailed action steps** for each alternative

## How It Works

### 1. Skill Analysis
The agent analyzes your top 5 strengths from 9 traits:
```python
TRAITS = [
    "analytical", "creative", "social", "leadership",
    "practical", "empathy", "risk", "focus", "curiosity"
]
```

**Example Profile:**
```python
profile = {
    "analytical": 9,    # Strong
    "focus": 8,         # Strong
    "curiosity": 8,     # Strong
    "creative": 5,      # Moderate
    "social": 4,        # Weak
    "practical": 7,
    "leadership": 6,
    "empathy": 3,
    "risk": 5
}
```

### 2. Alternative Discovery
For each alternative domain, the agent calculates:
- **Skill Overlap %**: How many required traits you already have
- **Matching Traits**: Specific skills that transfer
- **Difficulty Level**: How hard the pivot is
- **Time to Transition**: Estimated months needed
- **Risk Level**: Probability of success

### 3. Recommendation Tiers

| Overlap | Difficulty | Time | Risk | Action |
|---------|-----------|------|------|--------|
| **75%+** | Easy | 3-6 months | Low | Direct pivot |
| **60-75%** | Moderate | 6-12 months | Medium | Manageable transition |
| **50-60%** | Challenging | 12-18 months | High | Significant effort |
| **<50%** | Difficult | 18-24+ months | Very High | Major retraining |

## Core Functions

### 1. Explore Alternative Paths
```python
from agents.alternative_paths_agent import explore_alternative_paths

result = explore_alternative_paths(
    current_domain="technology",
    target_domain="technology",
    profile={...}
)
```

**Returns:**
```python
{
    "analysis": {
        "current_domain": "technology",
        "user_top_skills": [...],
        "total_alternatives_found": 8,

            "priority": "immediate"
        }
    ],
    "lateral_moves": {...},
    "summary": {...}
}
```

### 2. Analyze User Skills
```python
from agents.alternative_paths_agent import analyze_user_skills

skills = analyze_user_skills(profile)
# Returns top 5 traits with strength levels
```

**Output:**
```python
[
    {"trait": "analytical", "strength": 9, "level": "strong"},
    {"trait": "focus", "strength": 8, "level": "strong"},
    {"trait": "curiosity", "strength": 8, "level": "strong"},
    {"trait": "practical", "strength": 7, "level": "moderate"},
    {"trait": "leadership", "strength": 6, "level": "moderate"}
]
```

### 3. Compare Multiple Paths
```python
from agents.alternative_paths_agent import compare_career_paths

comparison = compare_career_paths(
    paths_to_compare=["technology", "business", "finance", "design"],
    profile={...}
)
```

**Output:**
```python
{
    "comparison": [
        {
            "domain": "finance",
            "skill_overlap": "75%",
            "difficulty": "moderate",
            "time_to_transition": "significant",
            "risk_level": "medium",
            "fit_score": 7.5
        },
        ...
    ],
    "recommendation": "finance",
    "all_viable": True
}
```

### 4. Risk-Based Categorization
```python
from agents.alternative_paths_agent import categorize_by_risk

categories = categorize_by_risk(alternatives)
```

**Returns:**
- `safe_choices` - Low risk, similar skills (70%+ overlap)
- `moderate_choices` - Medium risk, decent skills (55-70% overlap)
- `ambitious_choices` - High risk, significant change needed (<55% overlap)

### 5. Lateral Moves
```python
from agents.alternative_paths_agent import find_lateral_moves

moves = find_lateral_moves(
    current_domain="technology",
    target_domain="technology",
    profile={...}
)
```

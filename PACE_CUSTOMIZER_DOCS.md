# Pace Customizer Agent Documentation

## Overview
The **Pace Customizer Agent** adjusts learning roadmaps based on individual learner characteristics:
- **Available hours per week** - How much time they can dedicate to learning
- **Complexity tolerance** - Comfort level with difficult/abstract concepts
- **Learning capacity** - Speed at which they learn and retain information

## How It Works

### 1. Profile Analysis
The agent analyzes three dimensions of the user's learning profile:

```python
profile = {
    "hours_per_week": 10,          # Scale: 0-100
    "complexity_tolerance": 5,      # Scale: 1-10 (1=low, 10=high)
    "learning_capacity": 5          # Scale: 1-10 (1=slow, 10=fast)
}
```

### 2. Pace Calculation
Each dimension is converted to a multiplier:
- **Hours per week**: 
  - 0-5 hrs: 1.5x (slower pace needed)
  - 5-15 hrs: 1.0x (standard pace)
  - 15-30 hrs: 0.7x (can accelerate)
  - 30+ hrs: 0.5x (fast track possible)

- **Complexity tolerance**:
  - Low (1-3): 1.3x (more time for foundational learning)
  - Medium (4-6): 1.0x (balanced)
  - High (7-10): 0.8x (can handle complex topics faster)

- **Learning capacity**:
  - Slow (1-3): 1.4x (needs more review/retention time)
  - Average (4-6): 1.0x (standard)
  - Fast (7-10): 0.75x (quick learner, can accelerate)

### 3. Timeline Adjustment
The final multiplier is calculated as a weighted average:
```
multiplier = (hours_mult × 0.4) + (complexity_mult × 0.35) + (capacity_mult × 0.25)
```

This multiplier is applied to each step's duration in the roadmap.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage - Just Profile Analysis
```python
from agents.pace_customizer_agent import customize_pace

profile = {
    "hours_per_week": 10,
    "complexity_tolerance": 5,
    "learning_capacity": 5
}

result = customize_pace(profile)

print(result['pace_recommendation'])  # {"pace": "standard", ...}
print(result['tips'])  # Personalized learning tips
```

### With Roadmap Customization
```python
from agents.pace_customizer_agent import customize_pace
from agents.roadmap_agent import generate_roadmap

profile = {
    "hours_per_week": 5,
    "complexity_tolerance": 3,
    "learning_capacity": 4
}

roadmap = generate_roadmap("Data Science")
result = customize_pace(profile, roadmap)

# Get customized roadmap with adjusted timelines
customized_roadmap = result['customized_roadmap']['roadmap']
```

### Detailed Analysis
```python
from agents.pace_customizer_agent import analyze_learning_pace, calculate_pace_multiplier

pace_analysis = analyze_learning_pace(profile)
print(pace_analysis['hours_per_week'])      # Hours category & multiplier
print(pace_analysis['complexity_tolerance']) # Complexity category & multiplier
print(pace_analysis['learning_capacity'])    # Capacity category & multiplier

multiplier = calculate_pace_multiplier(pace_analysis)
print(f"Combined pace multiplier: {multiplier}")
```
